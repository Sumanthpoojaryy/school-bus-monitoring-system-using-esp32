 **Aim:**
 Automate the tracking of student attendance ,Provide real-time attendance tracking of the school bus using RFID technology. 

**Objective:**
Implementing school bus monitoring and notification systems using GPS modules and RFID technology can serve several important objectives to enhance the safety and efficiency of school transportation. Here are some key objectives:

**Student Safety:**
Real-time Tracking: Use GPS modules to track the school bus in real-time, allowing parents, school administrators, and transportation authorities to know the exact location of the bus at any given time.
Emergency Response: In case of emergencies or unexpected incidents, the system can quickly provide the location of the bus, enabling swift and targeted emergency response.

**Attendance and Security:**
RFID Attendance: Integrate RFID technology to monitor students getting on and off the bus. Each student can have an RFID card, and the system will automatically log attendance when they enter or exit the bus.
Identity Verification: Ensure that only authorized students are allowed on the bus, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.
**sms sending**
Schedule Adherence: Monitor the bus's adherence to the planned schedule, providing real-time updates if there are delays or changes.
Parental Communication:
Real-time Notifications: Parents can receive notifications when the bus is approaching their child's stop, ensuring timely pickup and drop-off.
Alerts for Delays: Instant notifications can be sent to parents if there are delays or unexpected changes in the bus schedule, keeping them informed.
Incident Reporting: In case of accidents or incidents, the system can provide valuable data for investigations and analysis.

Implementing these objectives can contribute to a safer, more efficient, and well-monitored school bus transportation system.

**Feature:** 

**1. Student Safety:**
Real-time GPS tracking ensures the continuous monitoring of the school bus's location. This information serves as a critical tool for parents, school administrators, and transportation authorities to guarantee the safety of students during transit. In emergencies, the system provides rapid and precise location data, facilitating swift and targeted emergency responses.

**2. Attendance and Security:**
Integrating RFID technology for student identification enhances security and attendance tracking. Each student is assigned an RFID card, automating the logging of attendance as they board or disembark the bus. This not only streamlines administrative processes but also ensures that only authorized individuals have access to the school bus, bolstering overall security.

**3. Parental Communication:**
Real-time notifications, triggered by GPS and RFID data, keep parents informed about the bus's proximity to their child's stop. This ensures timely pickups and drop-offs and provides peace of mind to parents by keeping them abreast of any unexpected delays or changes in the bus schedule.

**4. Cost Efficiency:**
By tracking fuel consumption and optimizing routes, the system contributes to cost efficiency. Data analytics enable the optimization of bus allocation based on demand, ensuring the judicious use of resources and minimizing operational costs.

In conclusion, the integration of GPS modules and RFID technology into school bus monitoring and notification systems serves a multifaceted purpose. It goes beyond basic tracking to encompass student safety, attendance automation, route optimization, parental communication,cost efficiency. This comprehensive approach addresses the diverse needs of school transportation, creating a secure, efficient, and well-monitored system that benefits students, parents, school administrators, and transportation authorities alike.
